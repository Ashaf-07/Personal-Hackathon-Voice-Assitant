🎤 Personal AI Voice Assistant
🗣️ “Your voice, your assistant — personalized AI that understands you”

This project was built during a Hackathon with the goal of creating a personalized, human-like AI voice assistant. Unlike traditional voice bots (like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant), this assistant is designed to be customizable — it can adapt to different voices, respond naturally, and integrate with external services.

🚀 Features

✅ Voice Input/Output – Speak to it naturally, and get human-like responses back
✅ Real-Time Processing – Low latency recognition + response flow
✅ Customizable Personality – Configure tone, style, and response behavior
✅ Multi-Modal Support (extendable) – Can connect with APIs for music, weather, YouTube, reminders, etc.
✅ Hackathon Optimized – Lightweight, fast, and demo-ready

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Core implementation

Speech Recognition – For voice-to-text input

Text-to-Speech (TTS) – For natural human-like responses

Groq API / LLM – Smart conversational brain

dotenv – Manage API keys securely
